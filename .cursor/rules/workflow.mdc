# Development Workflow

This document outlines development workflows and processes for the project.

## Getting Started

1. Install Node.js 20+ and npm
2. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies
3. Use `npm run dev` to start the development server

## Common Commands

- `npm run dev` - Start Vite development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint on all files
- `npm run lint:fix` - Fix ESLint issues automatically
- `npm run format` - Format code with Prettier
- `npm run typecheck` - Run TypeScript type checking
- `npm run test` - Run tests in watch mode
- `npm run test:unit` - Run all tests once

## Debugging

- Use F5 in VS Code/Cursor with the provided launch configurations
- "Vite Dev (Browser)" - Debug in Chrome with Vite dev server

## Logging

- Use `log.*` from `src/core/Logger.ts` instead of `console.log`
- Enable output: `localStorage.debug = "app:*"` in browser console
- Filter by system: `localStorage.debug = "app:api,app:auth"`

## Code Quality Standards

- Do not add comments unless they provide critical context that cannot be understood from well-written, semantic code
- Never disable linting rules without a very good reason and detailed explanation
- **Before completing any task, ALL of the following must pass:**
  ```bash
  npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm run test:unit
  ```
- If any check fails, fix the issues before considering the task complete
- Run `npm run build` to verify the build succeeds for significant changes

## Commits

- **Follow conventional commit format** - This enables automated changelog generation and semantic versioning
- Commit types:
  - `feat`: New features
  - `fix`: Bug fixes
  - `docs`: Documentation changes
  - `style`: Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
  - `refactor`: Code refactoring without changing functionality
  - `perf`: Performance improvements
  - `test`: Adding or updating tests
  - `chore`: Maintenance tasks, dependency updates, etc.
  - `build`: Changes to build system or external dependencies
- Format: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`
  - Example: `feat(auth): add login form validation`
  - Example: `fix(api): resolve timeout handling`

## Git Workflow

- Keep commits atomic and focused
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Pull and rebase before pushing
